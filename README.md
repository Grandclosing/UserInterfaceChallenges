# UserInterfaceChallenges
A fun repo of user-interface challenges where I try to recreate the main UIs of different applications!


To see examples, click on any of the sub-directories from here and check out the screenshots. Each project was probably written slightly differently - some with a React.js stack and CSS modules, others with vanilla JS and CSS.
